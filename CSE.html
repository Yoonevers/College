    <p>The Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) was established in the year 1991 with an intake of 30. Over the years, it has grown by leaps & bounds and the current intake is 180. The department is accredited first in 2005 by the National Board of Accreditation, New Delhi for three years, re-accredited in 2008 and recently in 2019 accredited for three more years. The department also offers M.Tech Program from 2009, in Computer Science and Engineering with an intake of 18. The department is recognized as a research centre by JNTUA to offer full-time Ph.D program.
The department is continuously undertaking the research, development and training activities in emerging technologies for students and faculty.To provide training and introducing new innovative courses based on the industry demands, the department is collaborating with National and International Institutes, R & D Organizations and Software Industries.The department is having MoU with IBM and CISCO and established required laboratories to offer certification courses in emerging technologies.
