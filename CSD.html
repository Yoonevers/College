    <p>The Department of Computer Science and Engineering  in Data Science  (CSE-DS) was established in the year 2021 with an intake of 60. Over the years, it has grown by leaps & bounds and the current intake is 120.

		Data science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data using modern tools and techniques to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make business decisions. With the help of data science, IT companies have successfully obtaining meaningful insights from unstructured and raw data.
		
		Data science has been helping businesses to grow beyond the conventional norms of data consolidation. It enables the companies to have access to more and more information and allows seeing new things in a better way, from a different perspective. In addition, it is the best way to find solutions to circumstances with varied and dispersed data. Data Science has varied applications, where business and commercial areas predominate. Data Science has also made inroads into the transportation industry, such as with driverless cars.
		
		The data science field is rapidly growing. It is estimated that the market will grow by nearly 28% by 2026. Hence, there are ample high paying opportunities for qualified data science professionals, and the demand will only rise with time. The important thing right now would be to focus on acquiring the right qualifications by undergoing data science.
		
		There are different job profiles available like Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Mining Engineer, Data Architect, Data Statistician and many for aspirants to join the exciting, growing, and demanding field of data science.
